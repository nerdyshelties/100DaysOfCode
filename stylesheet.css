/* Start typing your CSS below!Switch to the CSS tab and write 3 CSS blocks â€“ one each for your <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags.

Give each of the 3 CSS blocks a different font family and color.
Make your headings bold and small caps.
Give your paragraphs a line height of 30px and indent the text 10%.
Use text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, and word-spacing at least once.
Experiment and have fun! This is one of the few times you can have 4 different fonts, weights, colors, and styles on the same webpage! */
